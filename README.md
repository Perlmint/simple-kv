# Simple kvstore just for fun

I thought it would be fun to create a key-value store that supports simple `get` and `set` commands. And I wondered how simple it would be to use NodeJS.

So I made it.

Anyway, let's do a performance test. I make its protocal as same with `Redis` and performed a very simple random test.

You can find the result of the benchmark in `benchmark` directory.
